    <h2>My 3 Favorite Books </h2>

    <h3>Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed Harry Potter for its imaginative world-building and the sense of wonder it brings.<br/> The themes of friendship, bravery, and the battle between good and evil are timeless and deeply engaging.</p>
    
    <h3>Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle</h3>
    <p>I liked Sherlock Holmes because of the clever mysteries and Holmes' brilliant deductive reasoning.<br/> The stories are intellectually stimulating and always keep you guessing until the very end.</p>

    <h3>Finished by H. Rider Haggard</h3>
    <p>I appreciated Finished for its adventurous spirit and historical backdrop.<br/> The novel combines action, cultural encounters, and moral dilemmas in a way thatâ€™s both entertaining and thought-provoking.</p>
